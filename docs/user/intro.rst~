Available modules
+++++++++++++++++
The modules available to BatchQ will vary from system to system
depending on whether custom modules have been installed. Modules are
divided into four categories: functions, queues, pipelines and
templates.
The general syntax of the Q command is:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ q [function/queue/template] [arguments]

The following functions are available through the console interface and
using Python and are standard modules included in BatchQ which provides
information about other modules

.. autofunction:: batchq.queues.nohup.list

.. autofunction:: batchq.queues.nohup.help



Submitting jobs
+++++++++++++++
The BatchQ command line interface provides you with two predefined
submission modules: nohup and lsf. Nohup is available on every 


Creating configuration files
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Once you have automated the submission process you want to store the
configuration parameters in a file in order to shorten the commands need
to operate on your submissions. Using the example from before, this can
be done as

.. code-block:: bash

   q configuration brutus -i --username=user --working_directory="Submission" --command="./script" --input_directory="." --port=22 --server="server.address.com"

The above code creates a configuration named "brutus" which contains the instructions for submitting your job on "server.address.com".
Having created a configuration file you can now submit jobs and check status with 

.. code-block:: bash
   
   $ q lsf submit@brutus
   True
   $ q lsf pid@brutus
   12452

This keeps things short and simple. You will need to create a
configuration file for each server you want to submit your job. If for
one or another reason you temporarily want to change parameters of your
configuration, say the ``working_directory``, this can be done by adding
a long parameter:

.. code-block:: bash
   
   $ q lsf submit@brutus --working_directory="Submission2"
   True
